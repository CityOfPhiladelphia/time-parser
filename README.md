# time-parser

time-parser is a script which reads in a csv, parses strings that hold time information, and breaks them into fields that hold standardized 24-hour time strings.  It outputs a second csv.

You can put the file paths into an .env file within the project:

    INPUT_FILE=C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Projects\time-parser\inputOutput\COVID19_FreeMealSites_0.csv
    OUTPUT_FILE=C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Projects\time-parser\inputOutput\COVID19_FreeMealSites_1.csv

### The string stuctures that are handled include:

7:30AM - 12PM (1 time has a colon, both times have AM or PM)

12:00-1:30PM (both times have colons, only the 2nd time has an AM or PM)

11AM - 1PM (neither time has a colon, both times have AM or PM)

2-3pm (neither time has a colon, only the 2nd time has an AM or PM)

### General rules:

Uppercase and lowercase "AM" and "pm", and including periods between the letters (a.m.) are all handled.

Spaces or lack of spaces between the times and the dashes are all handled.

### 4 main parsing functions:

function: parseTimeWithColonAndAMPM
7:30AM - 12PM --> | 7:30 | 12:00 |

function: parseTimeWithColonAndEndAMPM
12:00-1:30PM --> | 12:00 | 13:30 |

function: parseTimeWithNoColonAndAMPM
11AM - 1PM --> | 11:00 | 13:00 |

function: parseTimeWithNoColonAndEndAMPM
2-3pm --> | 14:00 | 15:00 |
