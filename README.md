# time-parser

time-parser is a script which reads in a csv, parses strings that hold time information, and breaks them into fields that hold standardized 24-hour time strings.  It outputs a second csv.

You can put the file paths into an .env file within the project:

    `INPUT_FILE=C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Projects\time-parser\inputOutput\COVID19_FreeMealSites_0.csv
    OUTPUT_FILE=C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Projects\time-parser\inputOutput\COVID19_FreeMealSites_1.csv`
